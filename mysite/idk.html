            I started using  scratch at 2019  
                </br>
                <br>
            My 2 brothers are IT engineer they always make webs. I thought its fun and cool . So i wanted to become engineer because
            i am interested in it . 
            <br>
            <br>
            About 2 years ago my brother give me chance to study at other school so i was thinking about 2week or more .Then  i decided to study at this "NEST education IT school" .
            <br>
            This is why i am studying here.
            <br>
            <br>
            I learned VS code , coding,micro bit,github, spoj ,  hackerrank, and  a lot of things . I won't regret being in school.
            <br>
            <br>
            I like this school  alot.
            <br>
